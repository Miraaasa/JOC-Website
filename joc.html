  <p>Up to this point, researchers have been able to fuse two hydrogen atoms together successfully, but it has always taken more energy to do the reaction than they get back. Until recently, Scientists refer to the current breakthrough as “scientific net energy gain” — meaning that more energy has come out of the reaction than was inputted by the laser. That’s a huge milestone that has never before been achieved. But it’s only a net energy gain at the micro level. This means that the energy gain will probably need to be pushed much, much higher for fusion to actually be commercially viable.
